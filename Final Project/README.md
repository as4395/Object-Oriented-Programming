**Purpose:** Conduct a Data ETL project and document the process on Word. On Codepost, submit a Python file 
called "final.py" that contains a  completed Data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project. As the name suggests,
your project should successfully extract data (from either the web using an API or a file containing data) you think 
is interesting. Then, your project should look into this data to uncover some meaningful finding or findings from 
within it. Finally, your project should (up)load these findings into a meaningful text, CSV, website, or image format.

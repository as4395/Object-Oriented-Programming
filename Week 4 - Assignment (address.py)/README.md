Create a python script called "address.py" that 1) asks the user a series of prompts to create a structured mailing address for the user and 2) prints the structured mailing address for the user using formatted (f) strings.

Please use the following mailing structure in your code:

	First name (title case) Last name (title case)  
	Street address (title case)  
	City (title case), State (upper) Zip-code (no formatting)

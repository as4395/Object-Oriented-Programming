**Purpose:** Create a python file called "taxi_fare.py" Within this file, create a function called "fare_calculator" to
take the distance in kilometers as its only parameter and returns the taxi's total fare as the only result. The taxi 
fare is a base fare of $4.00 plus $0.25 for every 140 meters traveled. Outside of the function, write code that
asks the user to enter the distance they have traveled and uses this distance to calculate the taxi fare for the user. 
Finally, return the fare to the user using f-string and dollar formatting ($1.00).

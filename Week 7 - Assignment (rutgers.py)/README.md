**Purpose:** Create a python file called "rutgers.py" that uses an existing list called "full_names" (["Alex Johnson",
"Samantha Lee", "Juan Rodriguez", "Aaliyah Patel", "Daniel Kim", "Fatima Ali", "Adam Smith"]) to create a new list 
called "rutgers_emails" which includes the first character of someone's first name, the first character of their last 
name, a random three-digit integer, and "@rutgers.edu." The program should print the list of email addresses it 
generates as the output.

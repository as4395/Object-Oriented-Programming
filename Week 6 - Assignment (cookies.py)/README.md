**Purpose:** Create a python file called "cookies.py" to see whether a user has the necessary ingredients to make 
chocolate chip cookies. The ingredients ("flour", "butter", "sugar", "eggs", "chocolate chips") should be saved in a 
tuple called "ingredients." The user should be asked to enter as many ingredients as they would like, and the code 
should only stop executing once the user enters "stop."

**Purpose:** Create a python script called "average.py" that asks the user to enter as many numbers as they would 
like (enter "stop" to stop), computes the average of the numbers, and prints the average to the user. 

**Instructions:** Please review the feedback you received on your previous assignment(s) before you begin. For this 
assignment, please disregard special cases such as those where the user enters something besides "stop" when 
testing. Do not use an average function from a Python library; this defeats the purpose of the assignment: to 
create your own version of such a function.
